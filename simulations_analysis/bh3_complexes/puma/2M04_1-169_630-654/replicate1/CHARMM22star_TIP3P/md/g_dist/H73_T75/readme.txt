# In order to calculate the distances between the centers
# of mass of the side chains of H113 (H73 in PDB numbering)
# and T115 (T75 in PDB numbering), you should run:

sh calc_g_dist.sh

# Please be sure you are using a version of GROMACS lower
# than 5 when you run this analysis, since the g_dist
